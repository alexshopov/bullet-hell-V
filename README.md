Theme: **Consequences**

This is my first game jam, as well as my first exploration into learning Godot. My goal is to create a simple but polished and fun entry that will allow me to experiment with different Godot nodes and hack around with GDScript. The
core of the game is based on the [Your first 2D Game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html)
tutorial from the official Godot Docs. I ran through the tutorial to get a feel for the engine, then replaced
the provided assets and started expanding and re-writing the code to create this bullet hell experience.


## Development Process

### Tools

GDScript was written and debugged using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Sprite and background assets were created in [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/).

Additional sound and music were sourced from [OpenGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org/). See the in game credits or [Credits](#Credits) section below. with attribution both in game and below.
